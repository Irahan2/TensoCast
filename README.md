# ðŸ§  TensoCast: Tensor Decomposition for Time Series Forecasting

This project explores a modern approach to **multivariate time series forecasting** (such as traffic flow or energy demand) using **tensor decomposition** techniques.
Instead of flattening data and losing its structure, we aim to keep it in its natural multidimensional form â€” revealing deeper relationships hidden within the data.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Our Goal

Traditional models often simplify time series data by flattening it into 2D matrices, which breaks spatial and temporal relationships.
We want to change that by:

* **Preserving Structure:** Keep data as a multi-way tensor (e.g., `time Ã— sensors Ã— features`).
* **Extracting Hidden Patterns:** Use **CP** and **Tucker decomposition** to uncover latent relationships.
* **Improving Forecasts:** Feed these extracted factors into forecasting models like **LSTM** or **XGBoost**.
* **Evaluating Fairly:** Compare against classical baselines (VAR, GRU, Historical Average) using metrics like **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE**.

### ðŸ§© Project Plan

1. **Tensorization** â€” Transform raw time series into tensors using a sliding window.
2. **Decomposition** â€” Apply CP and Tucker to extract factor matrices and core tensors.
3. **Forecasting** â€” Use LSTM or XGBoost for the final prediction step.
4. **Comparison** â€” Evaluate against standard baselines and real-world datasets.

Our first goal is to build the pipeline with **PEMS-BAY** and **METR-LA** datasets.
Once stable, weâ€™ll move on to **Zdunksâ€™ dataset** for real-world validation and extend the model to **Online CP** (real-time updating).
